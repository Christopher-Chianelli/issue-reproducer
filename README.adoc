= getDeclaredMethods() violates contract

The getDeclaredMethods() javadoc explictly states "Returns an array containing Method objects reflecting all the declared methods of the class
or interface represented by this Class object, including public, protected, default (package) access, and private methods, but *excluding inherited methods.* "

Running `mvn quarkus:dev` returns "getValue, getId, setValue", which is incorrect since `getId` is inherited from a superclass.

Expected output:
"getValue, setValue"

Actual output:
"getValue, getId, setValue"
